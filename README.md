# Inventory Manager
 JavaFXML-based simple inventory management program

This was an early class project and my first attempt at using Java. The program consists of an interface displaying an Observable List of all parts and products currently held in inventory. The interface allows the user to select a part or product, and by switching between windows, modify, delete, or create a new part or product. The UI FXML was generated using Scenebuilder.
